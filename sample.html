		      <div class="sample_article">
				<p>Diwali is the festival of lights, celebrated with grandeur, zest, zeal and enthusiasm. The occasion has survived since ancient times as it heralds a few days of relief from the monotonous routined life. Family get-togethers, bursting crackers, distributing sweets, spreading smiles add a tint of euphoria to this auspicious occasion. To amplify the feels of festivity people embellish their houses, decorate them with colorful lights, candles and diyas. The sky seems to be studded with flying lanterns, and adorned with different patterns of fireworks. To experience the exuberance to the brim, people clad themselves in beautiful and ravishing ethnic wears.</p>

			<h5>The Joy of Dressing Up</h5>

			<p>Diwali is the opportunity for you to doll up in magnificent ethnics. Diwali may be less than a one-week event, but the plans and excitement of dressing up start bubbling about a month prior to the occasion. With a plethora of options most women choose magnificent ethnics. Online shopping, endless store hopping, do not seem to dwindle their ardour. Matching ornaments, and the perfect make up make the ladies look gorgeous. </p>

			<p>Whatever you choose to wear, it should carry a perfect combination of safety and style. Delve into the wide range of Kreeva’s clannish collection, moulded with the finest raw materials, and a variety of colors and patterns.  </p>

			<h5>Sarees</h5>

			<p>Sarees are correctly called to be six yards of grace. Sarees when draped, and coupled with the perfect blouse, append couture and elegance to your beauty. From chiffon to Chanderi, handloom to Banarasi,  georgette to ruffled sarees, you can slay the look with any one of these. It is an attire that blends both dignity and style.</p> 

			<p>Sarees have evolved from being a traditional clothing  to a chic fashion wear. They have successfully managed to bag the top position in every Indian woman’s heart. The eye-catching and elegant, sartorial and stunning garment makes you stand out in the crowd. </p>

Banglori Malai brings in a mixture of trend and tradition. Georgette sarees are an ideal for a classic chic evening, whereas nude shades of chiffon leave behind a tantalising effect. You can steal the thunder of the party by draping a bright and enigmatic net saree, or win hearts with a smile and a simple digital silk.</p>

		<h5>Salwar Kameez </h5>

		<p>Salwar Kameez is the ideal attire for an event where tradition encounters trends. It has managed to survive the long run, and occupy a place in every woman’s wardrobe. Diwali and salwars share an amazing kinship. The traditional wear gets its name from the top (salwar) and the bottom (kameez). This is often paired with matching or contrasting dupattas to step up the game.</p>

		<p>Satin, chanderi, linen or cotton salwars are a perfect balance of style, and comfort. For the main Diwali functions you could sport ethnics from fabrics like raw silk, brocades, georgettes, lace, net or embroidered work. You can couple light colored tops with complementary bottoms, or choose traditional glass work on your salwars. </p>

		 <p>Some prefer big heavy borders, whereas some opt for light or medium bordered attires and pair them with semi heavy jewellery. In recent times, women have gone all hearts over the fabric velvet, as it is a perfect blend of chic and class. Be it a call for a lavish, gorgeous look during the main events, or simple placid look during the morning activities,  salwars will respond in the most satiable way. </p>

		<p>Some lehengas are accentuated with high-quality fabric base, some are adorned with mirrors, and zari, some embellished with sequins, sparkles and embroideries.

		<h5>Anarkali</h5>

		<p>Anarkalis have ruled the rack for quite a long period of time, and Indian women have knitted an emotional attachment with it. No matter how many anarkalis you own, and how many times you have worn it, your love for this royal robe remains the same.

		      <div class="sample_article">
				<p>Knock! Knock! 
			You wake up, draw the curtains, and find a small extraterrestrial being knocking on your windowpane!? You find it cute but peep out of the window to see, scrambled skyscrapers, and UFOs that have ploughed the heart of your city! Scared you jump out of your bed, to realize it was just a bad dream.  </p>
			              
			<p>All of this could be true. Life could be ulterior, and probably all we see is a speck in the chaotic universe. Bigelow Ranch, The Devil’s Sea, and The Bermuda Triangle might be the peaks of an iceberg.  </p>

			<p>People have always wanted to quench their thirst regarding the cosmos, galaxies, celestial bodies, and the driving forces of the universe. There have been plenty of stories, theories, concepts, etc. based on space warfare, adventure, and interplanetary battles. All these come under the sub-genre space opera.</p>

			<p>Recursive dreams, as in the movie Inception could be the ultimate reality. Everything around us seems to be real, but that’s because we do not question or introspect. The entire existence could be similar to the adventure in the movie Gravity, where humans explore space. 
			With the overexploitation of resources, we may soon be in the shoes of Na’vi of Pandora in the movie Avatar. Na’vi were the natives of Pandora(The Moon), whose existence was threatened due to the expansion of human mining colonies. On squandering our resources, we would concoct to steal it from others, just like Planet Spcaeball tried to steal air from Druidia (in movie Spaceballs).
			And, finally, we’ll be left with no other option other than moving to a new planet, as in the movie Interstellar. The dilapidated view of the movie 2012 will be the final fate. </p>

			<p>Thus, life is no less than a movie, and we humans are just a mere fractal of this screenplay. Resources are ephemeral. Without realizing we have become a part of this space opera universe. As members of the cast, it is in our hands whether we choose the movie to play, pause or stop!!

		<li> Currently, the pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide locked down. Only stores of essential commodities are open for the public to buy things. Such pandemic has affected the hospitality industry like hotels and restaurants. People are unable to go to work and are living on their savings. Maintaining social distancing is important.

		<p>
		Keeping these into account, if the positive aspects are enhanced, and the shortcomings are overcome, the business will thrive and boom even more.</p>

		      <div class="sample_article">
				<p>
				Wake up! It's time to be even more beautiful! What is the first thing that strikes your mind when you hear 'beauty'? It's probably fashion, glamour, and flawless skin! Beauty is not just about your external appearance. It is also the way you present yourself. Greeting people with a vibrant smile and twinkling eyes is way more attractive than a somber yawn and sleepy eyes. </p>

				<p><strong>Can sleep make you a beauty queen?</strong><p>

				<p>Sleep nourishes the brain, body, and skin. According to Rebecca S Robbins, sleep eliminates about 60% of brain toxins. 

				Natural beauty is unmatched. What's the most beautiful apparel you can choose? It is your smile. To smile, you need to sleep properly and keep your mind fresh.</p>

				<p><strong>Sleep deprivation and dwindling beauty.</strong><p>

				<p>Lack of sleep affects the functioning of appetite hormones, thus causing frequent cravings. Sleep deprivation leads to fatigue and discourages your desire to workout, which intensifies weight gain. Insufficient sleep disrupts your immune system and is linked to inflammation and depression. Reduced sleep also affects your physical appearance.</p>

				<p>Recent definitions of beauty demand a slim and fit figure. But are you willing to embrace wrinkled skin, spots on your face, dark circles, and swollen eyes? If not, proper sleep is the only key. Long periods of deprived sleep can eventually lead to damaged skin. Lack of sleep affects your emotional and social interactions. It makes you short-tempered, and your inner beauty fades away as well.</p> 

				<p><strong>What is the solution? </strong><p>

				<p>Beauty naps enhance your glow but are they miracles? No. You need proper, consistent sleep hours. Soft bed linens, comfortable pillows, and cozy mattresses offer sleeping solutions. Prioritize your sleep and skin, and wake up with a glam 'I got up like this' look.</p>

				<p>Say goodbye to interrupted sleep schedules and wake up with an irresistible smile with Sleep to Beauty.</p>
